It looks like a possible fungal leaf issue on other. This often spreads in warm, wet weather. Remove the worst leaves so the fungus doesn't spread. Do not water from above. Water at the base in the early morning. Improve airflow by trimming the lower leaves so they don't touch wet soil. If many plants are affected, you may need a copper-based fungicide, but confirm with a local agronomist before spraying. If the problem spreads fast across the field, talk to your local agriculture extension officer for an on-site check.

⚠ Before using any chemical: Read the product label, follow local regulations, wear gloves and mask, and avoid spraying in mid-day heat.
